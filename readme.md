## 🧠 Chapter Summary

This chapter deepens core knowledge of JavaScript by diving into **functions**, **arrays**, **objects**, and **loops** — the building blocks of every modern JavaScript app. It bridges beginner logic with real-world programming patterns, helping you write reusable, clean, and structured code.

## 🔍 Key Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Functions
- Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions
- Arguments vs return values
- Calling one function from another

### 2️⃣ Arrays
- Storing multiple values in a single variable
- Array methods: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `indexOf`, `includes`
- Accessing and modifying array elements

### 3️⃣ Objects
- Creating objects using curly braces `{}` with properties and methods
- Accessing and updating values via dot and bracket notation
- Using `this` keyword inside object methods

### 4️⃣ Loops
- `for` loop basics and nested loops
- `while` loop for dynamic iterations
- Iterating over arrays and simulating repetitive logic

## 🛠️ Practice Projects / Exercises

Here are the hands-on challenges completed during this chapter:

### 📊 Team Average Calculator
- Calculates average scores between two teams
- Uses functions to determine the winner based on a simple condition

### 💰 Tip Calculator (Without Loops)
- Calculates tips based on given bill values using if/else
- Uses arrays to store inputs and outputs
- Demonstrates basic use of arrays and function abstraction

### ⚖️ BMI Calculator
- Compares BMIs between two people using objects
- Object properties include mass, height, and a `calcBMI()` method
- Displays the person with the higher BMI using `this`

### 🔁 Tip Calculator (With Loop)
- Uses a `for` loop to calculate tips and totals for multiple bill amounts
- Demonstrates looping through arrays and pushing to new arrays
- Built with real-world logic and clean code structure
